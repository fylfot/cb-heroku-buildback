# Heroku buildpack: Chicagoboss

It's mix of buildbacks [Erlang](https://github.com/jazzystring1/heroku-buildpack-erlang) and [ChicagoBoss](https://github.com/cstar/heroku-buildpack-chicagoboss).

NOTE: You need to have either an ebin/ directory or boss.config checked into Git in order for Heroku to identify this project as an Erlang app it can build.
